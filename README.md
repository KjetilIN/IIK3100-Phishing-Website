# IIK3100-Phishing-Website

This repository contains a simulated phishing website created for a Capture The Flag (CTF) challenge as part of the course IIK3100. The intention of this project is to replicate the NTNU email login page for educational purposes. It's crucial to note that this is a **fake website** designed explicitly for instructional and awareness purposes and should not be used to input any personal or sensitive information, especially login credentials.

## Disclaimer ⁉️

Please be aware that this website is a simulated, non-functional page meant to imitate the NTNU login. Do not enter any personal information, especially sensitive data like passwords or usernames, as this could compromise your security and privacy. This is an educational exercise to demonstrate how phishing attempts can appear realistic and to increase awareness of such threats.

This project is solely for educational and demonstration purposes. Please use this repository responsibly and ethically. Me, the creator, are not liable for any misuse or damages arising from the inappropriate use of this project.

## Technical Details

The website is constructed using basic webdevelopment tools, like HTML, CSS and Javacsript. <br>
It also uses Vercel for deployment: https://vercel.com/
